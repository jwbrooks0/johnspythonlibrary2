### This list of python libraries includes those needed to run johnspythonlibrary2.  It also includes a few libraries that I like to keep on hand.
# NOTE:  This does not include the MDSplus library.  See the attached readme for instructions on installing it. 
# Within your virtual environment, type the command: pip -r default_libraries.txt to install this list all in one go. 
# NOTE.  Make sure python3-dev is installed first.  sudo apt install python3-dev

### Spyder settings - I've also included a few of my favorite settings for my spyder environment.
# Consider reverting to the default settings first.  I've had issues where it pulls in an old spyder config file from outside the virtualenv.
# Note that these settings are for a mix of Spyder3 and Spyder4.
