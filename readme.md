This is my personal python library and contains functions that I've developed, borrowed, or wrapped for my personal use. 


### Installing ###
1. Make sure the [MDSplus](http://www.mdsplus.org/index.php/Documentation:Users:MDSobjects:Python) library is installed and in the python path.
2. Clone this library.  Make sure its directory is in the python path.
3. There are two _settingsTemplate.py files that need to modified and saved as _settings.py.
